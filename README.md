### Credit Risk Analysis
As a final project, our team has chosen to determine if machine learning can determine the credit risk of loan applications using supervised learning. Our dataset contains 74 columns of data per loan application, including the results, "Grade" and "Sub_Grade" which we will use as results for our machine learning agent.

We selected Credit Risk Analysis because we believe this is a relevant machine learning project that is useful in many different situations, and will give us good experience for our workplaces. As credit, and credit risk are widely used information in many workplaces, we belive that if the machine learning agent can predict the grade level of loan applications, we will be able save companies valueble time and money, and enable them to invest into investments with good return rates.

The data is collected from Kaggle, with 887379 rows and 74 columns. The data size is 441.77 MB. We have also collected data from https://data.census.gov.

We believe that the data contains enough information to successfully predict the Credit Grade of loan applications, based on the data provided, and external data from data.census.gov.
